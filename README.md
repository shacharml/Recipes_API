# Recipes API calls laybrary+ APP

This Java-based Android application generates random recipes using an API we created in SpringBoot. 
The app is built using Android Studio and provides users an easy way to discover new recipes and get inspired in their culinary adventures.

The API URL: https://github.com/shacharml/Recipes_API

The library inside takes care of executing the HTTP requests, handling the responses, and parsing the JSON data into Java objects with the Retrofit library can be found in the retrofit2 package in the project's dependencies.
The library executes the HTTP requests to the API backend we build.
